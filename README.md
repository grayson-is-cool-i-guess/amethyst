# amethyst
a website that lets you stream your desktop to it, so you can use your main computer from your school chromebook
amethyst allows streaming from any iframe, so you can simply open a local file with an iframe in it and you can use your computer on it.


# amethyst is in OPEN BETA
no source code will be posted for now (because its so skidded) and because you don't want to see it


# please, PLEASE, never expect this to be used commonly.
amethyst is in very early beta. its performance will not be great. i've already heavily optimized it to run at how it is. this is literally running with a node server and a prayer.

most of the frontend is chatgpt, i was too lazy to write it myself
